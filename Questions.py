I have a dataframe df1

in this dataframe there is the col 

["startYear", "runtimeMinutes", "genres", "isAdult", "averageRating", "numVotes"]


I'm using dash and plotly.

I want to know if there is a possiblity to show the averageRating over the year but by taking into account
the numVotes which must act as a weight on the averageRating
